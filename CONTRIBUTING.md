# Contributing

Looking to contribute to Tesser? That's great! There are a couple of ways to help
out. This document contains some general guidelines for each type of
contribution.

Please review [the FAQ](FAQ.md) before reporting a bug, asking a question or
requesting a feature.

## Translations

We use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/tesser-authenticator) to crowdsource
translations of Tesser for lots of different languages. **Pull requests that
add/update a translation are no longer accepted.** Crowdin is our single source
of truth for translations, to keep things easy to maintain.

The top 30 languages are available for translation. It's possible that yours is
not in that list. If that's the case, feel free to send us an email and we'll
add it.

## Pull requests

If you're planning on adding a new feature or making other large changes, please
discuss it with us first through [a
proposal](https://github.com/hyz/tesser/issues/new?labels=proposal&template=feature.md)
on GitHub. Discussing your idea with us first ensures that everyone is on the
same page before you start working on your change. We don't like rejecting pull
requests.

## Bug reports

We use GitHub's issue tracker to track bugs. To make bug reports easier to
follow up on for us, please fill out the form as accurately as possible. If a
bug report does not contain enough information, it will be closed. Duplicate bug
reports receive the same treatment.

Please consider trying to find the root cause yourself first and include your
analysis of the issue in your report. Perhaps even send us a patch that fixes
it! We're happy to help you if you get stuck along the way.

### Capturing a log with ADB

In some cases, we ask our users to obtain a debug log from their device. This is
typically only necessary if Tesser:

- Is unable to recover from an error and crashes.
- Only shows a generic error to the user, but writes a more detailed one to the
  log.

Capturing a log with the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) allows us to see the stack
trace and the exception that occurred.

#### Preparation

Before you can capture a log, you first need to go through a one-time setup
process on your Android device and computer.

##### Prerequisites

- Your Android device.
- A computer with Windows, Mac or Linux.
- A USB cable to connect your Android device to your computer.

##### Setup

**On your Android device**:

1. Navigate to `Settings -> About`, scroll down and start tapping on the build
   number until developer options are enabled.
2. Navigate to `Settings -> System -> Developer options` and enable `USB
debugging`.

These navigation steps may differ slightly across Android versions and ROMs.

**On your computer**:

3. Download and extract the SDK platform tools for Android:
   https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.
4. Start your terminal emulator (If you're on Windows, start PowerShell) and
   navigate to the folder where platform-tools was extracted.
5. Execute `adb devices`.

**On your Android device**:

6. A prompt will appear. Select "Always allow from this computer" and accept the
   connection.

#### Capturing a log

**On your Android device**:

1. Start Tesser.

**On your PC**:

2. Start your terminal emulator (If you're on Windows, start PowerShell) and
   navigate to the folder where platform-tools was extracted.
3. Start a log capture by executing the following commands.

   ```
   adb logcat -c
   adb logcat > debug.log
   ```

   The logcat command captures the full system log by default, which may expose
   some sensitive information. While this information can sometimes help with
   finding the root cause of the issue, it is not always necessary. To only
   capture the log output of Tesser, replace the last logcat command with the
   one below:

   ```sh
   adb logcat --pid=$(adb shell pidof -s com.hyz.tesser) > debug.log
   ```

   _If you are using a debug APK, replace `com.hyz.tesser` with
   `com.hyz.tesser.debug`._

**On your Android device**:

4. Reproduce the issue.

**On your PC**:

5. Stop the log capture with Ctrl+C.
6. Attach the `debug.log` file to your issue on GitHub.
